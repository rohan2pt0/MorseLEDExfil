# MorseLEDExfil
This project is a Python-based Morse code blinker that uses the Caps Lock LED to transmit messages in Morse code, inspired by the RARBG color scheme with green text on a black background. It works on Windows systems and provides terminal-based fallback for other platforms. Great for learning Morse code and experimenting with hardware control.
